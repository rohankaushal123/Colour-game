# Colour-game
This is a colour game for hackoverflow.   
With the use of HTML , CSS and Javascript.   
I've created a colour selector game which gives us the RGB values and we have to predict the correct colour.   
Given have Two levels easy and hard.    
Easy : Contains 3 squares.    
Hard : Contains 6 squares.  
On selection of correct colour , message appears CORRECT and all the squares and the above background changes to correct colour.  
On selection of wrong colour it fades away and message appears TRY AGAIN.  
We can also select PLAY AGAIN option on selection of correct colour.
